I'm looking for walking shoes, probably something in the Air Max category, but I can't figure out which ones are actually water proof (I sometimes walk in the rain).

I recently purchased a pair of  ""Nike Air Max 90 Essential"" exactly because they're sealed, but those ended up a size too big for me (which I realized too late), also the leather (or leather like) is highly rigid  and  bends pretty uncomfortably over my toes and digs into the side of my feet.

For starters... I'm not sure if the Nike Free x Metcon X is equivalent to the [Nike Free x Metcon](https://www.nike.com/t/free-x-metcon-gym-cross-training-shoe-VKoLdD/AH8141-003)  which is what I tried in store. They felt very comfortable in store but [these colorways](https://www.nike.com/t/free-x-metcon-x-mens-training-shoe-bjgDCK) just felt different to me.  Not sure if there's any difference or anyone else has had experience.

Three shoes tested:  

* [Nike Free TR V8 ~  Men's Gym/HIIT/Cross Training Shoe ~ $70](https://www.nike.com/t/free-tr-v8-mens-gym-hiit-cross-training-shoe-GZeoXk/AH9395-003)   
*  [Nike Zoom Train Command ~ $110](https://www.nike.com/t/zoom-train-command-mens-gym-boxing-shoe-spqPwg)
* [Nike Free x Metcon X ~ $84
](https://www.nike.com/t/free-x-metcon-x-mens-training-shoe-bjgDCK)

Style: I give preference to the Nike Free x Metcon.  

Comfort: Nike Free x Metcon --&gt; Nike Free TR V8 --&gt; Zoom Train Command.  The Zoom Train commands soles are just too flat (probably why it's a boxing shoe). It wouldn't be very comfortable running or jumping or walking long distances imo. It's a pretty close though between the Nike Free TR V8 / Metcons.   
I might just end up getting both the Metcons / TR V8's. 

Although I'm not digging that limited edition colorway on the metcons in person so I'll probably return those.

They wont hold and the shoes come loose after a few minutes of wearing them. This is an issue since these are running shoes. I contacted Nike support since I was unable to find these laces anywhere else online and they told me they don't offer replacement laces for these shoes. I am frustrated since now I have a $150 pair of running shoes that I cant even wear. Has anyone had this issue before and how did you solve this problem. I really like these shoes and I don't want to have to buy another pair since this is the only thing wrong with them.

470,deljanin0,4,1539631868.0,1,Nike,11043,"hey guys. I have some serious squeaking sound from my shoe. it comes from this part of the sole (shown in image - the green rubber part). On this shoe that rubber part is not, let's say, tightly fixed to the other part of the sole like on the other shoe and It can move so I guess it's making noise cause of friction between those two parts of the sole and it's irritating me so damn hard.. I red somewhere that i can stick needle threw the little hole (and potentially inject some small amount of wd40 so when it start to evaporate it might get all the air out) that's located under sole, but I'm not sure  that that hole goes right to the part that is problematic for me and I'm afraid that if I do that , I might get threw the air part and maybe cut the part of the sole that's filled with air. I can't find good repairman (everyone told me that it's not fixable) so I want to try something by myself or il just throw them away because they squeak so so loudly... I wore a lot of nikes and this is first time this happens to me and only this pair is bought from official nike store, so you can't tell they are fake (I mean they rly look like they are high quality, so I don't think they are fake).

I red a lot of posts like put some baby powder or wd40 on the insole, but my problem isn't coming from insole, it comes from really bottom part of the sole (outsole i guess). my enlish isn't very good, but you will understand everything from pictures.",air max 1 squeaking from the inside,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nike/comments/9ofxna/air_max_1_squeaking_from_the_inside/

506,anthonyd46,3,1539060723.0,3,Nike,11043,"I was at a Church tag sale on Saturday. This church has this tag sale 4 or 5 times a year and I usually find some great stuff there to sell on ebay. There is a house or two attached to the Church and they always have a tag sale on the same day since they share a yard with the Church. Anyway in front of the house there was stuff setup like there usually was and this kid no older than 7 was selling some things. Everything was super cheap $1-$3, but most of it was in terrible condition. Anyway I saw these Nike shoes there and with the green color I figured even though it was in terrible condition maybe I could sell it on ebay for $20 or something, because I know there are people out there that buy things on ebay for other uses than they are supposed to be used. I have seen people turn things into art projects or some people just collect regardless of condition etc. Whatever thats all beside the point...

Question here is I put the shoes on ebay. At the moment I just put a placeholder price tag of $175 until I researched them a bit more, but most likely I was going to change it to $17.50 if I found out they were worth nothing. I paid $2 for these shoes. During my research someone messaged me a very nasty messaging saying I am trying to sell bootleg shoes. I have no idea why this guy is accusing me of this as I said I bought them for a 7 year old. Can someone verify if these shoes are actually authentic and what they are exactly? Thank you and as you can see I am a super amateur at this.

The chocolate milk was easy to get out, but here's the real problem: when my shoes were drying, the blue dye of the upperlines would bleed into the white fabric next to the laces. I've tried to rewash them and I always get the blue out, but the bleeding will happen again when I let it airdry. Any advice

I bought a pair of PG2s 2-3 months ago and the rubber molding at the toe is starting to peel off (it’s an obvious defect, more than normal wear and tear, but can post a picture if needed). I only play basketball once a week and the shoes have only been worn on an indoor court, they still look practically brand new except for the defect. 

I bought the shoes from Champs and started by going there first and understandably they said it was a manufacturing issue and that Nike should handle it. So I go into a Nike store and they only want to give me a store credit for what the shoes are currently selling for ($55 since the PG 2.5 came out recently). I originally paid $110 for the shoes.

So I left the store and I called customer support and was told I would have to send the shoes in, but that I have to pay for the shipping. So my dilemma is that after paying $10-20 for shipping I’ll still probably only get the $55 store credit from Nike anyway. So I’m contemplating if I should just take their offer at the actual store and get a new pair of shoes or keep them. I can still play in the shoes but I’m worried they’re just going to get worse. 

I was wondering if anyone has had similar issues with a defective product and issues with Nike customer support and how/if it was resolved.

I was out looking sneakers to restore or customize and I came across these nikes for a few bucks that looks like AF1 but older. No AIR logo on it and the sizing tag must have been removed because I cannot seem to find it anywhere. No box either. I am just getting into the sneaker world and have enjoyed restoring a couple pairs and custom painting a pair so I am not to knowledgeable on a lot of sneakers out there yet.

730,daboomyup,1,1536355102.0,0,Nike,11043," Let me first start by saying I fully believe that it is a person’s right to peacefully protest however they choose to do it. “Peaceful protest” is not altered because people are angered by it. If NFL players taking a knee pisses you off, that is a YOU-problem. I wish they would not do it, but they have that right. Secondly, congratulations to Mr. Kaepernick on the big Nike contract – this is what capitalism is all about.  
However, I am confused about the issues now. First it was police brutality, then it was social injustice, now it is what?  
*Let’s talk about it.*  
This movement has taken a lot of turns.  
This all began on August 26, 2016 when Colin Kaepernick decided to sit during the national anthem. After the game he said ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” Then within a week, he wore socks that depicted police officers as pigs – which happens to be derogatory in nature. He associated those socks with “rogue cops.” Which is what these police officers who shoot unarmed people are – rogue. Every profession, ethnicity, community, etc … has bad apples; police officers are not immune to it. Kaepernick also followed this up with the revelation that he does not vote **and** that he had not, to that point, donated any of his money to help causes he is protesting.  
To sum it up, Kaepernick protested, then wore derogatory socks that portrayed a community as a whole but tried to say it was only meant for the few, then said he doesn’t vote, and then sad he doesn’t donate money – but he wants people to fix the problems. I’m confused too.  
Then it was showtime. Kaepernick began defending Fidel Castro’s policies. He said that Castro put more money into the education system than the prison system. That could be because Cuba did not need a prison, seeing as how they would assassinate you in your house, *in front of your kids* – but, apparently, that type of oppression can be overlooked if we throw a little extra money into the school system. Now I’m even more confused.  
Whether you agree or not, this made Kaepernick the face of the NFL protest. Now it doesn’t matter how well Malcom Jenkins handles it, this is Kaepernick’s battle and it always will be.  
Kaepernick claims to be “fight oppression of all kinds globally.” Just go look at his website.  
Nike’s checkbook may have changed that stance, though.  
Why? Well……  
In August 2018 a class action suit was filed against Nike by women. Among the allegations were:  


1. Executives were calling female counterparts “dykes” on “several occasions.”
2. A female employee started and was told her wage was “non-negotiable.” 2 months later, a male counterpart was hired to the same position but at a higher salary.
3. A male co-worker sent nude photographs to a female co-worker and followed that with more harassing text messages. After the female co-worker told the male co-worker to stop, the male co-worker began withholding information from the female co-worker. That information was imperative for the female co-worker to perform her job. The make co-worker also began skipping meetings that the female co-worker schedule and encouraged other co-workers to skip the meetings as well.
4. HR was informed of all of these incidents, but never took action.

I know what you might be saying – “these are just allegations.” That is my first response also. However, Nike publicly said they have “failed to promote enough women and minorities” and also said they have cultural issues. That is as close to an admission as you will get regarding allegations.  
What about those Nike sweatshops? Since the 1990’s Nike has used Chinese sweatshops to create their products. The workforce there, which is mostly women, works 60-84 hours a week, roughly 16 hours a day – but “earn” on average $62 a week. These shops have been criticized for using children in their factory’s and working them at the same rates for even less money. That sounds a little bit like slavery.  
How does Nike think they can be forgiven the quickest? Maybe sign Colin Kaepernick because he “fights oppression.”  
But let me ask you this Mr. Kaepernick, what about that oppression against “women and minorities?” Is it just about the money? What about Nike taking advantage of children in China to save a few dollars in the U.S.? Adidas and Puma were recruiting you for the same thing, why choose Nike when they have this type of systematic oppression going on in their own building? I thought we were fighting all social injustice here?  
A lot of this is confusing.  
But I do know one thing, if signing a multi-million dollar, multi-year deal with Nike is “sacrificing everything,” sign me up.

I believe Kaepernick has every right to protest peacefully, even if I greatly disagree with him. At Least he isn't rioting or burning flags. I think it was a dumb PR move for Nike to show they support him, just because of the backlash. It is funny watching all my republican friends freak out and blow it out of proportion. So no, I'm not burning my Nikes, I'm not boycotting them for taking a political stance, because it's stupid to destroy the shit you pay for because you don't agree with someone. Why do people care. ""Oh it's disrespectful to the people who served if you don't stand for the anthem"". Ok, I get that stance and I believe in it to a degree, but did you know that Kaepernick was given the idea from a military vet?

Nike, you make clothes to, correct? You make the jerseys for the football players, correct? What if instead of kneeling during the national anthem, any player who wants to take part in the protest puts on a black jersey instead. Take all the team jerseys and anywhere you find white, such as in the away jerseys, its now black. All the other colors remain the same so you can still tell what team they play for, but imagine that.

I personally feel that Nike made a very risky move with this.  Basically they just lost the entire ""Trump voters"" sales. I know that he wasn't the popular vote but he did win the election. That's a lot of people. 
I think that the minority consumer purchases will definitely go up. I'm not sure if it will balance out in favor of Nike.

I just bought a pair of Nike Hypervenom's in May, and played about 7 soccer matches with them so far. In my last game, the shoelace hole ripped and now there is part of the shoe where the lace is loose.  I was looking at the clauses for returns and it says shoes won't be accepted if there is:

o Excessive or inappropriate wearo Normal wear and tear

I guess my question is if a shoelace hole tearing would be considered normal wear and tear? I feel like I just got these shoes, and I can't see 7 matches as excessive. Just looking to see if anyone has experience with this?  I don't want to pay for the shipping of sending them in if it is just going to get denied.

Looking forward to your guys' thoughts! Thanks.
