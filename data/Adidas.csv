Unfortunately, despite former and current adidas employees frequenting the sub, and adidas fanatics being subscribers, *nobody here is qualified to accurately answer your customer service questions. Please avoid them if possible.* adidas CS is swamped because of the holidays and you may be on hold for ages. Email might take time. Chat might take time. There are thousands of others putting in requests just like you at any given moment. Employees frequenting the sub are not acting as adidas representatives outside of their time at work and cannot accurately aid in your customer service needs. Please refer to the sidebar for subreddit rules inclusive of “please avoid customer service questions”.



I will be locking threads with *specific CS questions* such as
- “When will they ship?”
- “It’s been X business days, why haven’t they been delivered?” 
- “Why is customer service taking long to get back to me?”

Their solution?  An apology and 15% voucher excluding yeezy, ultra boost and future limited drops, just a generic voucher for the site where we could have gotten 30% off just shopping cyber Monday.

This REALLY looks like a legitimate email.  It came directly to my email and wasn't with a group of other emails like most of those scammy emails do, no misspellings, and official looking links.  The email used however was from ""ADIDAS &lt;[info@adisportsonline.com](mailto:info@adisportsonline.com)\&gt; via [sendgrid.net](https://sendgrid.net) "" so that seems shady.

Anyway.. it looked real enough to me to cause concern since I know my personal information had possibly been compromised in the past since I was in the military and currently work for the government.. both of which had information stolen in the past few years.  Anyway, I called the official Adidas phone number's customer service (not the one from the email which btw was different than the official website's number) and the service agent confirmed that I didn't have an account and that no order was being shipped to me.

I saw a woman wearing what I'm currently 96% sure was an Adidas sweater. Looking everywhere online and asking around in stores and no one knowing what I'm looking for is making me doubt myself.

The description:

* a light grey/beige color
* long sleeve sweater/shirt
* it has the Adidas logo over the elbow
* most important feature: it's a bit like a tunic, where its long in the back than it is on the front
* there are slits on the slides for ease of movement

If anyone else has been following this saga you may remember that last weekend I went through a hell of s wasted morning trying to get those Cell propheres that were supposed to drop last Saturday. 

They were postponed to this weekend so as not to compete with the new Yeezys. Being the hypebeast I am, I again woke up early on a Saturday to go to the Times Sq flagship store and see if they had them as phone calls weren't leading me anywhere. 

Of course they still do not have it. Postponed again this time I have not been given a reason nor a potential release date. They simply pointed me to their app and told me to sign up for the Creators club for the exclusive updates regarding future releases - the very same app which has no product page for ANY of the DBZ sneakers, including those already released.

Fuck adidas. If anyone who's signed up for creators club has any idea what's going on regarding this I'd greatly appreciate a heads up.

If you move a release date up it is usually expected that the product is all ready to be released and their will be no problems. Not only was this not the case but they moved it back to the original date again. Which is fine whatever things happen. But why remove them from the online store? Why the fuck would you remove a highly valued product from the online store ONLY IN AMERICA BY THE WAY EVERYWHERE ELSE GOT THEM ONLINE. Why the fuck are the pharell shoes that nobody wants on the store but the Dragon ball shoes that will most likely make triple the profit not?

""So what? In store isn't that bad. Just get up and drive there."" Except only stored around in the fucking 15th century will get them. The closest one to me is in fucking New York which is an 8 hour drive. 

The biggest problem to me is the fucking lying that went on through the last 2 days from customer service. Everyone contradicted each other, I called yesterday they said in store only. I called again yesterday and they said online only. I called again today online again and an hour ago I called again and its in store only. How fucking hard is it to send a fucking memo to your customer service representatives? 

Also why the fuck is this stage different? Everyone says this is the best set so why the fuck was the first one online and this one wasn't? The Frieza ones were still in stock a week before these were going to drop because they were so ugly. Why are the best ones (that sold out instantly over seas by the way) not online?

The America branch of this company is a fucking joke. Usually a brand will sacrifice pleasing fans for maximizing profit or vice versa, but no smart person can say that by limiting the releases even more than they already were will make them any more money.

I ordered size 9, as was indicated by the confirmation email that I both screenshotted and saved in my inbox (I wanted some kind of paper trail on the off chance something like this happened). 

When I get the box in the mail I checked to ensure that it said SIZE 9 on the outside and then tried the shoes on. They seemed a bit loose which I found surprising considering the 350’s are supposed to run a half size small and I’m normally a size 9.  Whatever, I just put extra insoles in them, tried them on again, cut off the tags, and put them back in the box. I only wore them on the carpet in my room. 

Flash forward to the following day, (yesterday) I try them on again because I was a bit shaken up by the fact that the $220 shoes I had just bought didn’t fit quite right. Never wore them off the carpet once again. This time, as I’m fidgeting with the insoles I actually look at the size indicated on the interior tag and see that they are in fact SIZE 10. My heart sinks, as you would expect. At this point I wasn’t sure how to react so I just put them back in the box and took a nap to clear my mind. 

What should I do reddit?

I’m thinking I can either try and trade these for a size 9 if someone is offering, or try and get an exchange/refund if yeezysupply will admit to their mistake. I still haven’t contacted customer service for yeezy supply because I wanted some input on this first. 

Any help is appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

However, when clicking the return link you are redirected here: [https://www.adidas.com/us/order-tracker](https://www.adidas.com/us/order-tracker).  The issue is though, when you enter in your order information, there is no option to obtain a pre-paid return shipping label.  To make matters worse, contacting a representative from the customer service phone number is pretty much impossible as you can clearly see in this subreddit that others have had no luck getting in contact with a customer representative through the phone number.

But I never got a confirmation email or receipt in my email.  I tried using their chat help on the site... it doesn't work. I called them yesterday and was on hold for 92 minutes before I gave up.  I called this morning, another 90 mins and then I hung up. This afternoon I waited 60 minutes and still no answer. Just playing music and saying the wait will be longer than 15 minutes. 

Ive checked my ""promotions"" folder and my ""spam"" folder and nothing is in there from Adidas. 

I have sent emails, and everything. Still completely unable to reach anyone to find out if this order happened.  Does anyone have an actual phone number where you can reach a human being? Their phone number that they have on their website 1-800-982-9337 does NOT work at all. They tell you it will take 15 minutes in the recorded message but nobody answers. I had the phone on speaker for 90 minutes... twice!  

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions would be appreciated.  I know they main suggestion will be next time try Nike or Converse!  But stay away from Adidas.

Its at a point where i cant even walk or run in my ultraboost. And i really want to fix this issue if its possible. I have waited so long to get these, they are my dream shoes and I love how they look, really the coolest sneaker put there! But when i finally have them this occurs..

I have tried with everything i can come up with, using the shoe without insole, tried them with other insoles, heel grips made out of silicon, different lacing techniques. Nothing have worked. And ive had the shoes for too long to change them for a new pair. I would be really glad if someone/some people could help me with this. I dont want to have them laying around and not being used since i spent 180$ them. Thanks in advance! And sorry if there is any misspelling in the text, im on a phone writing this.

Hey guys! Most often than not, you have probably heard that the boost hype is dying down. But hype or not, I don't care as long I'm comfortable and happy with my purchase. I love my Ultra Boost and NMD.

Recently, I just bought this new NMD r1 logo pack. I'm a minimalist. Hence the color, I really don't like loud colors that much. I don't like the laces though, so I'll be doing a lace swap soon. Let me know what you think about the shoe overall and consider subscribing to my Youtube channel. Thanks!

Ive gone through 3 pairs I think, and they are awesome, but I want to try something else. 

My job has me walking a lot. Im a delivery guy for a restaurant, and this has me walking more than you might think. so, im looking for shoes that might be good for someone like me, or a UPS guy, or the mailman, etc.

Question: can I wear runner shoes daily? I mean, i know the shoe SWAT team arent going to pop outta nowhere and arrest me for it, but what I mean is will they hold up better or worse than Campus or similar regular shoes? I remember working for a guy who was into running, and this dude was ordering new shoes constantly, but idk if he was just hard on them, or a shoe junkie or what. do runner shoes just give super comfort, but wear out faster than regular shoes, are they better? or what?

here are some that im looking at:

https://www.adidas.com/us/energy-cloud-2-shoes/B44750.html

https://www.adidas.com/us/questar-ride-shoes/DB1346.html

i picked these because I think they all still kinda have a classic look, but more modern and sporty, and I want to try something with the knit instead of suede. 

thoughts? experiences? feel free to suggest anything else around $75, maybe $100 tops. thanks for your help, my dudes. :)

spez: i kept reading conflicting reviews on fit for various models, so decided to buy in store. I found an outlet with a good selection (though not the newest stuff), and they had a buy one, get 2nd pair 50% off.

i ended up going with a pair of Duramos and a pair of Lite Racers for $100 otd.

I bought a pair of Adidas doom sock pk yesterday. Today I wore them to school (i drive to college and mostly just walk between buildings so it's nothing intensive here) but when I came home I discovered some fraying on the sole.

I *might* have just stepped on something too hard or sharp however, I doubt it as I have been going to this college for 2 months with my Alphabounce and there hasn't been anything wrong. I know different shoes have different durability but as both the Adidas Doom sock pk and the adidas Alphabounce are close in price (and I like the looks of them) I thought it would last for quite a while at least.

I recently fished it back out again, and am considering selling it if it's worth it anything. Is anyone here able to tell me whether it's real or a counterfeit? And if it is real, how much it would be worth? I've tried my best to do some research, but clothes aren't my domain of expertise at the best of times, and I've been able to find no other similar design, though Clima365 does seem to be a real line.

They're the most flexible, lightweight, breathable, comfortable shoe I've ever owned.

Hoooooweever. They're a hot mess as far as durability goes. It's 4 years down the line and I've glued them back together and they're still falling apart. I have worn a hole through the insert down at my big toe and the sole is breaking away from the shoe in multiple places. There're holes in the cloth/mesh bits and in a couple other places.

So my girlfriend has suggested getting a pair of Adidas shoes to replace them. She has only ever worn Adidas and swears by their longevity.

I've been to every shoe store in the area, even drove up to STL one weekend and checked out shoe stores there in the mall. Not convinced by anything I saw and honestly Adidas selection in stores is always abysmally small compared to Nike most other brands.

I've looked at the Ultraboosts online but I'm not completely sold on them and their price tag that's 80% higher than what I paid for my Nikes. I also don't think that's their version of this shoe.
