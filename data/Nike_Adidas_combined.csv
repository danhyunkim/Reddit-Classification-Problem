I'm looking for walking shoes, probably something in the Air Max category, but I can't figure out which ones are actually water proof (I sometimes walk in the rain).

I recently purchased a pair of  ""Nike Air Max 90 Essential"" exactly because they're sealed, but those ended up a size too big for me (which I realized too late), also the leather (or leather like) is highly rigid  and  bends pretty uncomfortably over my toes and digs into the side of my feet.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a model you would recommend to fit my needs?

For starters... I'm not sure if the Nike Free x Metcon X is equivalent to the [Nike Free x Metcon](https://www.nike.com/t/free-x-metcon-gym-cross-training-shoe-VKoLdD/AH8141-003)  which is what I tried in store. They felt very comfortable in store but [these colorways](https://www.nike.com/t/free-x-metcon-x-mens-training-shoe-bjgDCK) just felt different to me.  Not sure if there's any difference or anyone else has had experience.

Three shoes tested:  

* [Nike Free TR V8 ~  Men's Gym/HIIT/Cross Training Shoe ~ $70](https://www.nike.com/t/free-tr-v8-mens-gym-hiit-cross-training-shoe-GZeoXk/AH9395-003)   
*  [Nike Zoom Train Command ~ $110](https://www.nike.com/t/zoom-train-command-mens-gym-boxing-shoe-spqPwg)
* [Nike Free x Metcon X ~ $84
](https://www.nike.com/t/free-x-metcon-x-mens-training-shoe-bjgDCK)

Style: I give preference to the Nike Free x Metcon.  

Comfort: Nike Free x Metcon --&gt; Nike Free TR V8 --&gt; Zoom Train Command.  The Zoom Train commands soles are just too flat (probably why it's a boxing shoe). It wouldn't be very comfortable running or jumping or walking long distances imo. It's a pretty close though between the Nike Free TR V8 / Metcons.   
I might just end up getting both the Metcons / TR V8's. 

Although I'm not digging that limited edition colorway on the metcons in person so I'll probably return those.

I am frustrated since now I have a $150 pair of running shoes that I cant even wear. Has anyone had this issue before and how did you solve this problem. I really like these shoes and I don't want to have to buy another pair since this is the only thing wrong with them.

I red somewhere that i can stick needle threw the little hole (and potentially inject some small amount of wd40 so when it start to evaporate it might get all the air out) that's located under sole, but I'm not sure  that that hole goes right to the part that is problematic for me and I'm afraid that if I do that , I might get threw the air part and maybe cut the part of the sole that's filled with air. I can't find good repairman (everyone told me that it's not fixable) so I want to try something by myself or il just throw them away because they squeak so so loudly...

A local shoe store in my area is selling a pair in [this colorway](https://sneakerbardetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nike-epic-react-first-look.jpg) (if I remember correctly) at a discount, around $15 cheaper than the other Epic React models. The sales people said it's an earlier model hence the discount.

I asked if it was part of the batch that had the popping issues but the sales people don't have any idea. Can I assume just by the colorway and it being an earlier model that it might have the issue? I want to buy it because of the discount but I'm worried it has the exact issue everyone is talking about. Any advice?

506,anthonyd46,3,2544,3,11043,"I was at a Church tag sale on Saturday. This church has this tag sale 4 or 5 times a year and I usually find some great stuff there to sell on ebay. There is a house or two attached to the Church and they always have a tag sale on the same day since they share a yard with the Church. Anyway in front of the house there was stuff setup like there usually was and this kid no older than 7 was selling some things. Everything was super cheap $1-$3, but most of it was in terrible condition. Anyway I saw these Nike shoes there and with the green color I figured even though it was in terrible condition maybe I could sell it on ebay for $20 or something, because I know there are people out there that buy things on ebay for other uses than they are supposed to be used. I have seen people turn things into art projects or some people just collect regardless of condition etc. Whatever thats all beside the point...

Question here is I put the shoes on ebay. At the moment I just put a placeholder price tag of $175 until I researched them a bit more, but most likely I was going to change it to $17.50 if I found out they were worth nothing. I paid $2 for these shoes. During my research someone messaged me a very nasty messaging saying I am trying to sell bootleg shoes. I have no idea why this guy is accusing me of this as I said I bought them for a 7 year old. Can someone verify if these shoes are actually authentic and what they are exactly? Thank you and as you can see I am a super amateur at this.

542,Joetron1,0,2543,2,11043,"Forgive me for the formatting, but I’m on mobile. 

I bought a pair of PG2s 2-3 months ago and the rubber molding at the toe is starting to peel off (it’s an obvious defect, more than normal wear and tear, but can post a picture if needed). I only play basketball once a week and the shoes have only been worn on an indoor court, they still look practically brand new except for the defect. 

I bought the shoes from Champs and started by going there first and understandably they said it was a manufacturing issue and that Nike should handle it. So I go into a Nike store and they only want to give me a store credit for what the shoes are currently selling for ($55 since the PG 2.5 came out recently). I originally paid $110 for the shoes.

So I left the store and I called customer support and was told I would have to send the shoes in, but that I have to pay for the shipping. So my dilemma is that after paying $10-20 for shipping I’ll still probably only get the $55 store credit from Nike anyway. So I’m contemplating if I should just take their offer at the actual store and get a new pair of shoes or keep them. I can still play in the shoes but I’m worried they’re just going to get worse. 

I was wondering if anyone has had similar issues with a defective product and issues with Nike customer support and how/if it was resolved.

After the 11.5's (second image) came, I noticed something was off with the heel. In the first image you can see the round curvature of the 11's, and in the second photo the curvature is almost non-existent. Instead on the 11.5's it's very steep. I'm wondering are the 11.5's broken. When I look online all other huaraches look like the 11's.

730,daboomyup,1,2540,0,11043," Let me first start by saying I fully believe that it is a person’s right to peacefully protest however they choose to do it. “Peaceful protest” is not altered because people are angered by it. If NFL players taking a knee pisses you off, that is a YOU-problem. I wish they would not do it, but they have that right. Secondly, congratulations to Mr. Kaepernick on the big Nike contract – this is what capitalism is all about.  
However, I am confused about the issues now. First it was police brutality, then it was social injustice, now it is what?  
*Let’s talk about it.*  
This movement has taken a lot of turns.  
This all began on August 26, 2016 when Colin Kaepernick decided to sit during the national anthem. After the game he said ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” Then within a week, he wore socks that depicted police officers as pigs – which happens to be derogatory in nature. He associated those socks with “rogue cops.” Which is what these police officers who shoot unarmed people are – rogue. Every profession, ethnicity, community, etc … has bad apples; police officers are not immune to it. Kaepernick also followed this up with the revelation that he does not vote **and** that he had not, to that point, donated any of his money to help causes he is protesting.  
To sum it up, Kaepernick protested, then wore derogatory socks that portrayed a community as a whole but tried to say it was only meant for the few, then said he doesn’t vote, and then sad he doesn’t donate money – but he wants people to fix the problems. I’m confused too.  
Then it was showtime. Kaepernick began defending Fidel Castro’s policies. He said that Castro put more money into the education system than the prison system. That could be because Cuba did not need a prison, seeing as how they would assassinate you in your house, *in front of your kids* – but, apparently, that type of oppression can be overlooked if we throw a little extra money into the school system. Now I’m even more confused.  
Whether you agree or not, this made Kaepernick the face of the NFL protest. Now it doesn’t matter how well Malcom Jenkins handles it, this is Kaepernick’s battle and it always will be.  
Kaepernick claims to be “fight oppression of all kinds globally.” Just go look at his website.  
Nike’s checkbook may have changed that stance, though.  
Why? Well……  
In August 2018 a class action suit was filed against Nike by women. Among the allegations were:  


1. Executives were calling female counterparts “dykes” on “several occasions.”
2. A female employee started and was told her wage was “non-negotiable.” 2 months later, a male counterpart was hired to the same position but at a higher salary.
3. A male co-worker sent nude photographs to a female co-worker and followed that with more harassing text messages. After the female co-worker told the male co-worker to stop, the male co-worker began withholding information from the female co-worker. That information was imperative for the female co-worker to perform her job. The make co-worker also began skipping meetings that the female co-worker schedule and encouraged other co-workers to skip the meetings as well.
4. HR was informed of all of these incidents, but never took action.

I know what you might be saying – “these are just allegations.” That is my first response also. However, Nike publicly said they have “failed to promote enough women and minorities” and also said they have cultural issues. That is as close to an admission as you will get regarding allegations.  
What about those Nike sweatshops? Since the 1990’s Nike has used Chinese sweatshops to create their products. The workforce there, which is mostly women, works 60-84 hours a week, roughly 16 hours a day – but “earn” on average $62 a week. These shops have been criticized for using children in their factory’s and working them at the same rates for even less money. That sounds a little bit like slavery.  
How does Nike think they can be forgiven the quickest? Maybe sign Colin Kaepernick because he “fights oppression.”  
But let me ask you this Mr. Kaepernick, what about that oppression against “women and minorities?” Is it just about the money? What about Nike taking advantage of children in China to save a few dollars in the U.S.? Adidas and Puma were recruiting you for the same thing, why choose Nike when they have this type of systematic oppression going on in their own building? I thought we were fighting all social injustice here?  
A lot of this is confusing.  
But I do know one thing, if signing a multi-million dollar, multi-year deal with Nike is “sacrificing everything,” sign me up.

I think it was a dumb PR move for Nike to show they support him, just because of the backlash. It is funny watching all my republican friends freak out and blow it out of proportion. So no, I'm not burning my Nikes, I'm not boycotting them for taking a political stance, because it's stupid to destroy the shit you pay for because you don't agree with someone. Why do people care. ""Oh it's disrespectful to the people who served if you don't stand for the anthem"". Ok, I get that stance and I believe in it to a degree, but did you know that Kaepernick was given the idea from a military vet? At least he isn't burning flags and flooding streets like a lot of protesters do, and I respect him for that, even if I'm against the reasoning of his protest.

I personally feel that Nike made a very risky move with this.  Basically they just lost the entire ""Trump voters"" sales. I know that he wasn't the popular vote but he did win the election. That's a lot of people. 
I think that the minority consumer purchases will definitely go up. I'm not sure if it will balance out in favor of Nike.

So I need a fresh pair of shoes for this Winter and I came across the Presto Utility.

Even though I watched a couple of videos about the shoe, I still have some questions regarding the shoe in winter.

Has anyone of you worn them in winter? Do they keep your feet warm, if yes, do they sweat and is the shoe water resistant even after walking through the snow?  
Would be nice if someone of y'all could help me and tell me some facts about the shoe.

I just bought a pair of Nike Hypervenom's in May, and played about 7 soccer matches with them so far. In my last game, the shoelace hole ripped and now there is part of the shoe where the lace is loose.  I was looking at the clauses for returns and it says shoes won't be accepted if there is:

o Excessive or inappropriate wearo Normal wear and tear

I guess my question is if a shoelace hole tearing would be considered normal wear and tear? I feel like I just got these shoes, and I can't see 7 matches as excessive. Just looking to see if anyone has experience with this?  I don't want to pay for the shipping of sending them in if it is just going to get denied.

Looking forward to your guys' thoughts! Thanks.

September comes around, I was at work the Saturday of the release of Goku, busy as all hell. I get home my wife asks ""did you manage to get a pair of Goku??"", A sudden moment of despair creeped over me, I was so busy at work I had entirely forgot.

Fast forward to the Vegeta drop, I'm at work, again. This time I'm prepared, I make the time to get into the waiting room, finally get through to the order menu, get my order placed, and boom Vegeta on the way. I was happy with just that.

As it turns out my wife has been behind my back, hunting these shoes on eBay as my Christmas present. She was toying with me last week, asking which ones I'd like to have in some sort of hypothetical world. I said Goku, Gohan, or even Cell. I said ""oh my God you got me another pair didn't you??"" She leaves the room and comes back with a size 10 pair of Goku. I was ecstatic!
 She confesses that she has purchased every single release thus far, and I will be an owner of the entire collaboration, provided I land the shenron releases!

My friend and I copped the 1.0 OG drop on the 1st, order confirmed as per usual and payment sent, this morning Adidas cancelled both our orders and when we contacted help they said the system messed up and sold more pairs than they had. Brutal, refund will take 2-4 weeks to get back

Their solution?  An apology and 15% voucher excluding yeezy, ultra boost and future limited drops, just a generic voucher for the site where we could have gotten 30% off just shopping cyber Monday.

Thousands of dollars spent on yeezy and ultra boosts in the past and now terrible customer service to handle their mistake.

1154,TiresomeTable60,0,2552,3,9666,"Not sure where this got my email but I received three emails in a row claiming I set up an account, changed my account settings then placed a ""COD order for a pair of ""Women's Adidas Swim Adilette Cloudfoam Plus Graphic Slides"" which was priced at $3299.00.  This REALLY looks like a legitimate email.  It came directly to my email and wasn't with a group of other emails like most of those scammy emails do, no misspellings, and official looking links.  The email used however was from ""ADIDAS &lt;[info@adisportsonline.com](mailto:info@adisportsonline.com)\&gt; via [sendgrid.net](https://sendgrid.net) "" so that seems shady.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway.. it looked real enough to me to cause concern since I know my personal information had possibly been compromised in the past since I was in the military and currently work for the government.. both of which had information stolen in the past few years.  Anyway, I called the official Adidas phone number's customer service (not the one from the email which btw was different than the official website's number) and the service agent confirmed that I didn't have an account and that no order was being shipped to me.  We both found it laughable that it was a Cash on Delivery shipment and that the cost of one pair of these shoes showed at over $3k.

I saw a woman wearing what I'm currently 96% sure was an Adidas sweater. Looking everywhere online and asking around in stores and no one knowing what I'm looking for is making me doubt myself.

The description:

* a light grey/beige color
* long sleeve sweater/shirt
* it has the Adidas logo over the elbow
* most important feature: it's a bit like a tunic, where its long in the back than it is on the front
* there are slits on the slides for ease of movement

They were postponed to this weekend so as not to compete with the new Yeezys. Being the hypebeast I am, I again woke up early on a Saturday to go to the Times Sq flagship store and see if they had them as phone calls weren't leading me anywhere. 

Of course they still do not have it. Postponed again this time I have not been given a reason nor a potential release date. They simply pointed me to their app and told me to sign up for the Creators club for the exclusive updates regarding future releases - the very same app which has no product page for ANY of the DBZ sneakers, including those already released.

Fuck adidas. If anyone who's signed up for creators club has any idea what's going on regarding this I'd greatly appreciate a heads up.

2) Adidas APP doesn't even list these sneakers as available, or existing. Searches for the model and colorway turn up nothing.

3) Called multiple stores in the NYC area. All had the same answer: only the 5th avenue flagship store will carry these shoes. 

4) I come to 5th avenue, stand outside in the **rain** for an hour and a half and am told I cannot enter the premises without the QR
code one receives after reserving the shoes via the app or website (which as we already covered is not possible for this shoe).

This is a fucking shit show. Everyone's here for the yeezys and I could give a fuck about that shit I'm just trying to get these Cell Propheres without paying double the retail price. Ridiculous.

If you move a release date up it is usually expected that the product is all ready to be released and their will be no problems. Not only was this not the case but they moved it back to the original date again. Which is fine whatever things happen. But why remove them from the online store? Why the fuck would you remove a highly valued product from the online store ONLY IN AMERICA BY THE WAY EVERYWHERE ELSE GOT THEM ONLINE. Why the fuck are the pharell shoes that nobody wants on the store but the Dragon ball shoes that will most likely make triple the profit not?

""So what? In store isn't that bad. Just get up and drive there."" Except only stored around in the fucking 15th century will get them. The closest one to me is in fucking New York which is an 8 hour drive. 

The biggest problem to me is the fucking lying that went on through the last 2 days from customer service. Everyone contradicted each other, I called yesterday they said in store only. I called again yesterday and they said online only. I called again today online again and an hour ago I called again and its in store only. How fucking hard is it to send a fucking memo to your customer service representatives? 

Also why the fuck is this stage different? Everyone says this is the best set so why the fuck was the first one online and this one wasn't? The Frieza ones were still in stock a week before these were going to drop because they were so ugly. Why are the best ones (that sold out instantly over seas by the way) not online?

The America branch of this company is a fucking joke. Usually a brand will sacrifice pleasing fans for maximizing profit or vice versa, but no smart person can say that by limiting the releases even more than they already were will make them any more money.

I've contacted the shop where I bought them but they can't do anything because I had six months to report a claim if I had one. I bought these sneakers on 08.01.2018. and didn't use them for running or something like that. Only used them for walks to my job. And that is like a 5 min walk. 
 I am really dissapointed and i dont know is there anything I can do? I mean, this is just wrong, have paid almost 200€ for this pieace of shit! I live in EU.
 Is there some kind of official chanel to report my claim directly to adidas in EU?

I ordered size 9, as was indicated by the confirmation email that I both screenshotted and saved in my inbox (I wanted some kind of paper trail on the off chance something like this happened). 

When I get the box in the mail I checked to ensure that it said SIZE 9 on the outside and then tried the shoes on. They seemed a bit loose which I found surprising considering the 350’s are supposed to run a half size small and I’m normally a size 9.  Whatever, I just put extra insoles in them, tried them on again, cut off the tags, and put them back in the box. I only wore them on the carpet in my room. 

Flash forward to the following day, (yesterday) I try them on again because I was a bit shaken up by the fact that the $220 shoes I had just bought didn’t fit quite right. Never wore them off the carpet once again. This time, as I’m fidgeting with the insoles I actually look at the size indicated on the interior tag and see that they are in fact SIZE 10. My heart sinks, as you would expect. At this point I wasn’t sure how to react so I just put them back in the box and took a nap to clear my mind. 

What should I do reddit?

I’m thinking I can either try and trade these for a size 9 if someone is offering, or try and get an exchange/refund if yeezysupply will admit to their mistake. I still haven’t contacted customer service for yeezy supply because I wanted some input on this first. 

Any help is appreciated!

Ive checked my ""promotions"" folder and my ""spam"" folder and nothing is in there from Adidas.

I first bought a pair of solar boost which on the right foot had a extreme heel slippage, i returned them thinking it was something wrong with the shoe. Same problem on the new solar boost again on new pair, so i return those too and payed the differencial cost to buy the ultraboost 4.0. Didn't notice anything at first but then i noticed the heel slippage.

Its at a point where i cant even walk or run in my ultraboost. And i really want to fix this issue if its possible. I have waited so long to get these, they are my dream shoes and I love how they look, really the coolest sneaker put there! But when i finally have them this occurs..

I have tried with everything i can come up with, using the shoe without insole, tried them with other insoles, heel grips made out of silicon, different lacing techniques. Nothing have worked. And ive had the shoes for too long to change them for a new pair. I would be really glad if someone/some people could help me with this. I dont want to have them laying around and not being used since i spent 180$ them. Thanks in advance! And sorry if there is any misspelling in the text, im on a phone writing this.

Hey guys! Most often than not, you have probably heard that the boost hype is dying down. But hype or not, I don't care as long I'm comfortable and happy with my purchase. I love my Ultra Boost and NMD.

Recently, I just bought this new NMD r1 logo pack. I'm a minimalist. Hence the color, I really don't like loud colors that much. I don't like the laces though, so I'll be doing a lace swap soon. Let me know what you think about the shoe overall and consider subscribing to my Youtube channel. Thanks!

I’ve scoured the Internet multiple times but still for the life of me I can’t ID this hat. It was a black polyester (I believe) 6 panel strap back hat with a flat brim, the logo on the front was a rubber, stitched on, patch about the size of a silver dollar kind of themed like adidas’ utility stuff, so it had raised lettering and a simple adidas logo. Honestly looked kind of like a challenge coin. Whole hat was black even the rubber logo and stitching. I purchased the hat at a Zumiez outlet store within a year ago.

1632,Finest7,3,2541,0,9666,"I usually buy Adidas Campus shoes, because they check all my boxes. classic Adidas look, very durable/last a long time, comfortable, go with anything, and the price is good. Ive gone through 3 pairs I think, and they are awesome, but I want to try something else. 

My job has me walking a lot. Im a delivery guy for a restaurant, and this has me walking more than you might think. so, im looking for shoes that might be good for someone like me, or a UPS guy, or the mailman, etc.

Question: can I wear runner shoes daily? I mean, i know the shoe SWAT team arent going to pop outta nowhere and arrest me for it, but what I mean is will they hold up better or worse than Campus or similar regular shoes? I remember working for a guy who was into running, and this dude was ordering new shoes constantly, but idk if he was just hard on them, or a shoe junkie or what. do runner shoes just give super comfort, but wear out faster than regular shoes, are they better? or what?

here are some that im looking at:

https://www.adidas.com/us/swift-run-shoes/B37730.html

https://www.adidas.com/us/energy-cloud-2-shoes/B44750.html

https://www.adidas.com/us/questar-ride-shoes/DB1346.html

i picked these because I think they all still kinda have a classic look, but more modern and sporty, and I want to try something with the knit instead of suede. 

thoughts? experiences? feel free to suggest anything else around $75, maybe $100 tops. thanks for your help, my dudes. :)

spez: i kept reading conflicting reviews on fit for various models, so decided to buy in store. I found an outlet with a good selection (though not the newest stuff), and they had a buy one, get 2nd pair 50% off.

i ended up going with a pair of Duramos and a pair of Lite Racers for $100 otd.

I bought a pair of Adidas doom sock pk yesterday. Today I wore them to school (i drive to college and mostly just walk between buildings so it's nothing intensive here) but when I came home I discovered some fraying on the sole.

I *might* have just stepped on something too hard or sharp however, I doubt it as I have been going to this college for 2 months with my Alphabounce and there hasn't been anything wrong. I know different shoes have different durability but as both the Adidas Doom sock pk and the adidas Alphabounce are close in price (and I like the looks of them) I thought it would last for quite a while at least. This on first day is pretty worrying.

And if it is real, how much it would be worth?

1962,teleteletel,5,2533,2,9666,"In 2014 I bought a pair of Nike Free Run 5.0s from the Nike store in the Mall of America. I had no intention of buying a pair of shoes but saw a pair there, tried them on, fell in love immediately, and bought them on the spot.

They're the most flexible, lightweight, breathable, comfortable shoe I've ever owned.

Hoooooweever. They're a hot mess as far as durability goes. It's 4 years down the line and I've glued them back together and they're still falling apart. I have worn a hole through the insert down at my big toe and the sole is breaking away from the shoe in multiple places. There're holes in the cloth/mesh bits and in a couple other places.

So my girlfriend has suggested getting a pair of Adidas shoes to replace them. She has only ever worn Adidas and swears by their longevity.

I've been to every shoe store in the area, even drove up to STL one weekend and checked out shoe stores there in the mall. Not convinced by anything I saw and honestly Adidas selection in stores is always abysmally small compared to Nike most other brands.

I've looked at the Ultraboosts online but I'm not completely sold on them and their price tag that's 80% higher than what I paid for my Nikes. I also don't think that's their version of this shoe.

So I come to you guys who I assume know just about every shoe Adidas carries with this question: What's Adidas's version of my shoe and would you recommend it?",adida competitor to nike free run 50 2014,https://www.reddit.com/r/adidas/comments/90bv2o/adidas_competitor_to_nike_free_run_50_2014/,0
